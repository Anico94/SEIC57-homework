                    She retired in 1986. During retirement, she enjoyed traveling, playing card games, and spending time with her family and friends. 
                    She also liked to talk to students about school. She encouraged students to keep studying and to work hard. 
                    She told them to learn more about math and science. And she said to never give up on their dreams!
