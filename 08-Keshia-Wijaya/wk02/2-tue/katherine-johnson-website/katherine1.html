            <h1>Katherine Johnson</h1>
            <div class="answer1">
                <p>After college, Katherine became a teacher. She taught school until she got married and had children.
                    When her husband became very sick, she started teaching again to support her family.
                    When Katherine was 34, she heard that NACA (later called NASA) was hiring African American women to solve math problems.
                    These workers were called “computers.” Katherine applied for one of the jobs, but the jobs were already taken.
                    Still, she did not give up. She applied again the next year, and this time NACA hired her.
                    She worked with a large group of women who were all computers like she was. 
                    But Katherine was different from the other human computers. She asked a lot of questions.
                    She wanted to learn more about her work and about NASA. So she started going to meetings.
                    Before Katherine, only men attended these meetings. She changed that! She learned so much that she left her job as a computer.
                    She became a team member who worked on different space projects for NASA.</p>
