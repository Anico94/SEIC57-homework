//The Calculator

// ## Part 1
// - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
// - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
// - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
// - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
// - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

// ## Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
// - Take half of the number and store the result.
// - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).



const squareNumber = function (aNumber) {
    let result = aNumber**2;
    return (`The result of squaring the number ${aNumber} is ${result}`)   
}
console.log(squareNumber(3))

const halfNumber = function (aNumber) {
    let result = aNumber/2;
    return (`Half of ${aNumber} is ${result}`)
}
console.log(halfNumber(10))


// Strings
// These exercises will test your knowledge of string functions, conditionals, and arrays. For many of them, you will want to consult the JavaScript strings reference to find useful string methods to call.

// DrEvil
// Create a function called DrEvil. It should take a single argument, an amount, and return ' dollars', except it will add '(pinky)' at the end if the amount is 1 million. For example:

//   DrEvil(10): 10 dollars
//   DrEvil(1000000): 1000000 dollars (pinky)

// MixUp
// Create a function called mixUp. It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. For example:

//   mixUp('mix', 'pod'): 'pox mid'
//   mixUp('dog', 'dinner'): 'dig donner'
// Look up the JavaScript string reference to find methods which may be useful!



function DrEvil(a) {
    let result;
    if (a === 1000000) {
      return (`${a} dollars (pinky)`)   
    }
    return (`${a} dollars`)   
  }
  console.log(DrEvil(1000000))
