                "description": "Excerpt from James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study The 'key' to Ulysses, as M. Valery Larbaud has remarked, is plain to see on its title-page: the name 'ulysses'. It is in the story of the Odyssey that we may find a clue to the obscurities in this modern epic of a Dublin day. And the justification for this approximation of the ancient to the modem is founded on mysticism, 'upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood', like the Church, like all the theories that, hot for certainties, sapient man has concocted to solve the scheme of things. In writing this study I have not hesitated to emphasize the importance of the Homeric analogies and to explore certain remote hinterlands of esoteric thought. The analogy-hunter, like the cryptogrammatist dissecting a Shakespearian text, is liable to cut a somewhat ridiculous figure, if he let his hobby run away with him. But it is a far cry from Ithaca to Dublin, from the wisdom of the East to the practical reason of the West, and, if some of my analogies seem far-fetched, they are, I make bold to say, none the less apposite for that. Moreover, a reader of Ulysses needs to bear in mind that, though it is in no sense a parody of the Odyssey.

                "description": "This strikingly illustrated edition presents Joyceâ€™s epic novel in a new, more accessible light, while showcasing the incredible talent of a leading Spanish artist. The neo-figurative artist Eduardo Arroyo (1937â€“2018), regarded today as one of the greatest Spanish painters of his generation, dreamed of illustrating James Joyceâ€™s Ulysses. Although he began work on the project in 1989, it was never published during his lifetime: Stephen James Joyce, Joyceâ€™s grandson and the infamously protective executor of his estate, refused to allow it, arguing that his grandfather would never have wanted the novel illustrated. In fact, a limited run appeared in 1935 with lithographs by Henri Matisse, which reportedly infuriated Joyce when he realized that Matisse, not having actually read the book, had merely depicted scenes from Homerâ€™s Odyssey. Now available for the first time in English, this unique edition of the classic novel features three hundred images created by Arroyoâ€”vibrant, eclectic drawings, paintings, and collages that reflect and amplify the energy of Joyceâ€™s writing.",
