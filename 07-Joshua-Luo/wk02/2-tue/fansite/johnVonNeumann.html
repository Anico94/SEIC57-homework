            <p>John von Neumann (1903-1957) was one of the most prominent mathematicians of the 20th century. He made major contributions not only to mathematics but also to a number of fields in science such as computer science, physics, economics, meteorology, theory of automata and, last but not least, to game theory. It is no exaggeration to state that whichever scientific field he worked in, what Neumann accomplished in each can be considered a lifetimeâ€™s work. Neumann engaged in a wide range of scientific activities, but two of his accomplishments fundamentally changed the world of science and revolutionised advancement in science and technology in the 20th century.</p>

            <p>elaborated the principles that lay the foundation stones for the operation of computers (in a paper written in 1945). These principles, commonly-known as Neumann principles, determine the operation of computers even today.</p>
