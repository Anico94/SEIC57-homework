            <p>The Computer and the von Neumann Architecture</p>

            <p>While consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project, von Neumann described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer’s memory in the same address space, a principle which still holds for today’s computers unlike the earliest computers that were ‘programmed’ by altering the electronic circuitry. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture (sometimes also referred to as Princeton Architecture) as a result of von Neumann’s paper, the architecture’s description was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly, inventors of the ENIAC. John von Neumann also consulted for the ENIAC project. He recognized the need for parallelism in computers but equally well recognized the problems of construction and hence settled for a sequential system of implementation.</p>
