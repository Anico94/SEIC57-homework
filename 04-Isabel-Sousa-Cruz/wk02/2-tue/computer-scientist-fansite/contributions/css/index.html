                <h2>Unix</h2>
                <p>In 1966, Ken was hired by Bell Labs to work on the MULTICS project (The Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). The project was designed with consortium including General Electric (GE), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Bell Labs as it was successor to MITs Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS), MULTICS was an ambitious, innovative, and large operating system which was supposed to support hundreds of simultaneous users. Unfortunately, the project soon became unwieldy, which, with the fact that it struggled accommodating over three simultaneous users, resulted in its gradual demise.</p>
                <p>1969 was the magic year when UNIX was born, humans first went along to the moon, ARPANET was released (the precursor on the Internet), as well as a number of other interesting events occurred. It was also the year which Thompson wrote the Space Travel game.</p>

                <h2>The Space Travel Game</h2>
                <p>Space Travel is an early video game developed by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model of the Solar System with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies.</p>

                <h2>Thompson's construction</h2>
                <p>In computer science, Thompson's construction algorithm, also called the McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson algorithm, is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). This NFA can be used to match strings against the regular expression.</p>

                <h2>Belle - chess machine</h2>
                <p>Belle was a chess computer developed by Joe Condon (hardware) and Ken Thompson (software) at Bell Labs. In 1983, it was the first machine to achieve master-level play, with a USCF rating of 2250. It won the ACM North American Computer Chess Championship five times and the 1980 World Computer Chess Championship. It was the first system to win using specialized chess hardware.</p>
                <p>In its final incarnation, Belle used an LSI-11 general-purpose computer to coordinate its chess hardware. There were three custom boards for move generation, four custom boards for position evaluation, and a microcode implementation of alpha-beta pruning. The computer also had one megabyte of memory for storing transposition tables.</p>
                <p>At the end of its career, Belle was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
