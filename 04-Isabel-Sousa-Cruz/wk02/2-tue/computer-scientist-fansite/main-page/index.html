                <img src="img/ken-thompson.jpg" alt="Ken Thompson">

                <p>Ken Thompson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1943. He graduated with a bachelor of science (1965) and a master's degree (1966), both in electrical engineering and computer science, from the 'University of California,' Berkeley.</p>

                <p>In 1969, Thompson and colleague Dennis Ritchie created the UNIX operating system at Bell Telephone Laboratories. UNIX was a scaled-down version of the MIT MULTICS operating system, one meant to run on the new smaller minicomputers becoming available at the end of the 1960s. When re-written in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie, UNIX became a truly portable operating system capable of running on many different hardware platforms. The C language itself was widely adopted and is in wide use today.</p>
