                    <p>Dirac's work has been concerned with the mathematical and theoretical aspects of quantum
                        mechanics. He
                        began work on the new quantum mechanics as soon as it was introduced by Heisenberg in 1925 -
                        independently producing a mathematical equivalent which consisted essentially of a
                        noncommutative
                        algebra for calculating atomic properties - and wrote a series of papers on the subject,
                        published
                        mainly in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, leading up to his relativistic theory of the
                        electron
                        (1928) and the theory of holes (1930). This latter theory required the existence of a positive
                        particle
                        having the same mass and charge as the known (negative) electron. This, the positron was
                        discovered
                        experimentally at a later date (1932) by C. D. Anderson, while its existence was likewise proved
                        by
                        Blackett and Occhialini (1933) in the phenomena of “pair production” and “annihilation”.</p>

                    <p>Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to
                        Paul
                        Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote of Dirac, "I have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the
                        dizzying
                        path between genius and madness is awful." In another letter concerning the Compton effect he
                        wrote, "I
                        don't understand Dirac at all."</p>
